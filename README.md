# LOZ-FANMADE
A project for making a fanmade Legend of Zelda game. LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR, WHILE THIS IS PERFECTLY LEGAL (AS LONG AS WE MAKE NO MONEY FROM IT), NINTENDO FROWNS UPON IT.

What we are looking for:

•People who can code

•People who can help develop story and plot

•People who can come up with ideas for how things should look

•People who can help write music [I kind of have that covered]

•People who can help direct

Comment below on what you would like to do.
